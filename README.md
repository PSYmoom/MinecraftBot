# MinecraftBot for Discord Servers
The Linux version of MinecraftBot.

## Notes
* The server was tested using Ubuntu Server.
* Used ssh to communicate with the server and tmux to deattach program from the terminal, allowing MinecraftBot to stay open even after the ssh connection is severed.
* Ensure that the all of the folders have the proper read and write permissions and that the firewall for the ports being used are unblocked.
